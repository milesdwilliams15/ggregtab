Yet another R package for making regression tables... Why?!

The `{ggregtab}` package is a hyper-specific solution to a hyper-specific problem I have. As an academic researcher, I love the look of the pdf manuscripts I can make using Quarto and RMarkdown. Unfortunately, most of the journals that I submit my work to want Word Documents. This wreaks havoc with regression tables. They're never formatted the way I like, and often I have to contend with tables being split between two pages because of their placement in my Quarto or RMarkdown file. This is a never ending source of frustration. To add insult to injury, I couldn't find a solution other than editing my .docx files after the fact. That's not ideal for replication.

I then had a realization. I don't have this problem with the plots I make for my manuscripts, and the reason is that they're rendered as images. No matter their placement in my Quarto or RMarkdown files, plots are never split between pages. So what if I had a method for quickly making a plot that just happens to look like a table?

Hence, I give you `{ggregtab}`. It produces plots that look like regression tables. Specifically, it produces ggplots that look like regression tables, making them both easy to produce and easy to customize using the vast ecosystem of tools and packages centered around `{ggplot2}`.

To install the package just write:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("milesdwilliams15/ggregtab")
```

## Main Functions

The main functions in the package are:

- `ggregtab()`
- `tidy_coeftest()`

`ggregtab()` produces a ggplot that looks like a regression table once given a tidy coefficient test object.

Importantly, this object must contain eight unique columns. In addition to the usual that are produced for model objects using `broom::tidy()`, other columns required are `conf.low`, `conf.high`, `model`, and `N`. The first two are needed if you want to show confidence intervals instead of standard errors in your tables. The latter are needed for model labeling and for showing sample sizes.

`tidy_coeftest()` is a helper function that makes it easy to get your model objects into the correct shape. You don't have to use this function, however, as long as the coefficient test object you give to `ggregtab()` contains the required columns.

## An Example

Here's some code that produces a regression table using data from the `mtcars` dataset. If I didn't know any better, I wouldn't know that this was a plot rather than a decently formatted regression table.

```{r fig.height=4, fig.width=4}
## open the package
library(ggregtab)

## fit a regression model
fit <- lm(mpg ~ hp + wt + cyl, mtcars)

## prep it for visualization
tidy_fit <- tidy_coeftest(fit)

## plot the regression table
ggregtab(tidy_fit)
```

For those curious few who care, here's what the `tidy_fit` object looks like that `ggregtab()` expects to see:

```{r}
tidy_fit
```


## Advanced Options

There are many ways to customize your regression tables. I've included some examples below.

### Updating Labels and Text

Since the output of `ggregtab()` is a `ggplot()` object, you can use all the `{ggplot2}` extras you want to customize it. For example you can use `+ labs()` to give your table a title and subtitle. You can also use `scale_y_discrete()` to update the labels for the model terms.

```{r}
ggregtab(tidy_fit) +
  labs(
    title = "A Regression Table",
    subtitle = "With OLS estimates"
  ) +
  scale_y_discrete(
    labels = c(
      "Cylinders",
      "Weight",
      "Horse Power",
      "(Intercept)"
    )
  )
```

You can also update the model summary stats shown below the coefficient summaries. By default just the sample size is shown. I excluded other summary stats like R-squared or negative log-likelihood because in most cases I'm not concerned about these metrics of model performance (R-squared is overrated anyway for drawing conclusions about model fit within sample, and I find log-likelihood generally uninformative). 

But you might feel otherwise. So here's how you can update the model summary stats to show whatever you want.

First, create a customized label by calculating the stats you care about. Second, give this new label to `scale_x_continuous()`. Under the hood a continuous x scale is used for any and all model IDs. This was a round-about solution for making the plot show an upper and lower axis label simultaneously---one for the model stats and the other for the model caption.

```{r}
## get adjusted r-squared and N
smry_fit <- summary(fit)
rsqrd <- smry_fit$adj.r.squared
nobs <- nrow(model.frame(fit))

## paste together as a new label for the bottom x-axis
smry_stats <- paste0(
  "N = ", nobs, "\n",
  "Adj. R2 = ", round(rsqrd, 2)
)

## update the plot
ggregtab(tidy_fit) +
  labs(
    title = "A Regression Table",
    subtitle = "With OLS estimates"
  ) +
  scale_y_discrete(
    labels = c(
      "Cylinders",
      "Weight",
      "Horse Power",
      "(Intercept)"
    )
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = 1,
    labels = smry_stats
  )
```

One last thing I'll show you is how to update the font of your tables. Here's an example using "serif". I haven't tested it, but I assume you could use something like `{showtext}` to use a wider variety of fonts than what are available by default with `{ggplot2}` as well.

```{r}
ggregtab(tidy_fit, base_family = "serif") +
  labs(
    title = "A Regression Table",
    subtitle = "With OLS estimates"
  ) +
  scale_y_discrete(
    labels = c(
      "Cylinders",
      "Weight",
      "Horse Power",
      "(Intercept)"
    )
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = 1,
    labels = smry_stats
  )
```

### Multiple Models

You can show multiple regression models at once. When doing this, just make sure that the tidy coefficient test object you give `ggregtab()` has unique model IDs for each model you want to show. You can control this using the `model` option in `tidy_coeftest()`.

Also, when you start adding more models, you may want to play around with the `ratio` option in `ggregtab()`. By default this is set to `1/5`, but you'll probably need to adjust this as you add more columns to your table. This `ratio` option is given to `coord_fixed()` under the hood, which is a convenient method for keeping consistent dimensions for data visualizations.

Here's an example with three regression models:

```{r}
fit1 <- lm(mpg ~ hp, mtcars)
fit2 <- lm(mpg ~ wt, mtcars)
fit3 <- lm(mpg ~ hp + wt, mtcars)

dplyr::bind_rows(
  tidy_coeftest(fit1, model = "Model 1"),
  tidy_coeftest(fit2, model = "Model 2"),
  tidy_coeftest(fit3, model = "Model 3")
) |>
  ggregtab(ratio = 1/2) +
  labs(
    title = "Many Regression Models",
    subtitle = "Still OLS Estimates"
  ) 
```

### Using Robust or Clustered Standard Errors

Under the hood, `tidy_coeftest()` uses `lmtest::coeftest()` before it passes things over to `broom::tidy()`. This means you can supply your own variance-covariance matrix for coefficient tests. `tidy_coeftest()` lets you pass such a matrix to `coeftest()` using the same `vcov.` syntax. Just specify `vcov. = ...` and provide your alternative variance-covariance matrix. This is useful if you want to show robust or clustered standard errors.

You might do this using functions from the `{sandwich}` package, like so:

```{r}
tidy_coeftest(
  fit,
  vcov. = sandwich::vcovHC(fit, type = "HC1")
) |>
  ggregtab() +
  labs(
    title = "A Regression Table",
    subtitle = "With HC1 Standard Errors"
  ) +
  scale_y_discrete(
    labels = c(
      "Cylinders",
      "Weight",
      "Horse Power",
      "(Intercept)"
    )
  )
```

### You Can Do Even More

I've just barely scratched the surface of what you can do. Since `ggplot()` itself is so infinitely customizable, so are the tables you can make with `ggregtab()`.

You can also use any model object or class that is compatible with `lmtest::coeftest()`. I haven't checked, but that covers most model types that most researchers use most of the time.

Now go have fun disguising ggplots as regression tables!
